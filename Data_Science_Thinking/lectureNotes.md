### definition and KDD process 
**KDD** (Knowledge discovery in databases).  
 **The overall process** of non-trivial extraction of implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful knowledge from large amounts of data. 
- **data preprocessing**.  
	- data integration 
	- data cleaning 
	- data selection 
	- data transformation 
- data mining
- pattern evaluation (post processing)
- visualization 
### Data mining tasks and methods 
#### prediction methods   
Use some variables to predict unknown or future values of other variables.
- Classification 
- Regression   
 Goal:predict a value of a given **continious valued variable ** based on the values of other variables,assuming a linear or nonlinear model of **dependency**  
 
#### description methods   
Find human-interpretable patterns that describe the data.
- Clustering  
 Finding groups of objects such that the objects in a group will be similar (or related) to one another and different from (or unrelated to) the objects in other groups.  
 Automatically learn the structure of data
